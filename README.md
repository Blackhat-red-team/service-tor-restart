Installing Python: Python is pre-installed on many Linux distributions. To check if Python is already installed on your system, run the following command in the terminal: 
python --version
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
2-Installing Required Libraries:
a. Subprocess: Subprocess is a built-in Python module and doesn't require any additional installation.

b. Time: Time is another built-in Python module and doesn't require any additional installation.

Once Python is installed, you can use the pip package manager to install any additional libraries required for your project. For example, if you need to install the requests library, you can run the following command:

pip install requests
This will download and install the requests library along with any dependencies required.

If you're using Python 3, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip. For example:
pip3 install requests

pip install schedule
sudo apt-get install python-dev
